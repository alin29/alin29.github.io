	<h2>My Classes in UB</h2>
  <h3>
	  I am currently majoring in Computer Science which means that I need to take CSE 115. Right now I'm learning Java. Our teacher, 
	  Carl Alphonce, creates labs for us to do on our own time. At first, these labs weren't so difficult. However, as time progressed,
	  not only his labs started to get harder, his teachings were pretty hard to follow along as well. I really don't know if I can continue
	  with this major without failing. Additionally, I am enrolled in two clubs to learn more about 
	  programing, ACM and SASE. My other classes are MTH 141 which is currently teaching Calculus and ENG 105 
	  which is basically giving us a bunch of essays every week.

	<h2>In CSE 199</h2>
<h3>
	CSE 199 is a class that revolves around the internet. Unlike many classes in UB, this class relies on group activities
	and students watching videos. Additionally, us students must contribute by creating videos ourselves. 
	So far in CSE 199, I have made 3 relatively boring videos. Just please don't watch these videos. I'm just adding them to make my
	website to look better than it actually is.
